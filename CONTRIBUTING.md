# 🧩 Contributing to Aethel

We follow a **documentation-first development process** — all architectural and design decisions are written down before implementation begins.

## 📘 What “Documentation-First” Means

- All **application architecture, design plans, and workflows** are first documented in Markdown files.
- These documents are then broken down into **issues or tasks**.
- Issues are grouped and tracked through **sprints**.

If there aren’t many issues open, it means we’re currently in the documentation phase.  
New tasks and issues will be added as documentation evolves.

If you’re contributing documentation, please follow our [documentation guidelines](./docs/index.md).

## 🏃 Working on a Sprint

Always pick an **active sprint issue** and create a pull request (PR) linked to it.  
Refer to the latest sprint details in the [README.md](./README.md).

You can also join our community server to get early notifications when new sprints begin.

## 🏅 Duplicate PRs

If multiple contributors submit PRs for the same issue, high-quality and genuine efforts may still be tagged as  
`hacktoberfest-accepted` — even if not merged — after review by maintainers.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Clone** your fork locally and create a branch named:  
   `<concise-name>/issue-<issue-number>`
3. **Commit and push** your changes.
4. **Open a PR** and fill in the PR template thoroughly.
5. **Assign a reviewer** from [./.github/CODEOWNERS](./.github/CODEOWNERS).

## 🌟 Getting Priority Review

To receive faster feedback:

- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/HP2YPGSrWU) to discuss your ideas directly with maintainers.
- GitHub comment sections may receive slower responses.
- Ensure you’ve reviewed the **Discord Rules** outlined in [README.md](./README.md) before joining.

## 💡 Pro Tip

Read through the project documentation and existing issues before starting your contribution.  
Understanding the context makes your PRs stronger, more aligned, and more likely to be merged quickly.
